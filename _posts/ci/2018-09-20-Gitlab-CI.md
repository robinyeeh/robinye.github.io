#### Register a Runner under GNU/Linux:

1. Run the following command:


```
sudo gitlab-runner register
```


2. Enter your GitLab instance URL:


```
Please enter the gitlab-ci coordinator URL (e.g. https://gitlab.com )
https://gitlab.com
```


3. Enter the token you obtained to register the Runner:


```
Please enter the gitlab-ci token for this runner
xxx
```


4. Enter a description for the Runner, you can change this later in GitLab's UI:


```
Please enter the gitlab-ci description for this runner
[hostame] my-runner
```


5. Enter the tags associated with the Runner, you can change this later in GitLab's UI:


```
Please enter the gitlab-ci tags for this runner (comma separated):
my-tag,another-tag
```


6. Enter the Runner executor:


```
Please enter the executor: ssh, docker+machine, docker-ssh+machine, kubernetes, docker, parallels, virtualbox, docker-ssh, shell:
docker
```


If you chose Docker as your executor, you'll be asked for the default image to be used for projects that do not define one in .gitlab-ci.yml:


```
Please enter the Docker image (eg. ruby:2.1):
alpine:latest
```
